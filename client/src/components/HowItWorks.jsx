            Crowdfunding platforms are websites that enable interaction between
            fundraisers and the crowd. Financial pledges can be made and
            collected through the crowdfunding platform. Fundraisers are usually
            charged a fee by crowdfunding platforms if the fundraising campaign
            has been successful. In return, crowdfunding platforms are expected
            to provide a secure and easy to use service. Many platforms operate
            an all-or-nothing funding model. This means that if you reach your
            target you get the money and if you don’t, everybody gets their
            money back – no hard feelings and no financial loss. There are a
            number of crowdfunding types which are explained below. This guide
            provides unbiased advice to help you understand the three most
            common types of crowdfunding used by profit-making SMEs and
            startups: peer-to-peer, equity and rewards crowdfunding.
            Peer-to-peer lending The crowd lends money to a company with the
            understanding that the money will be repaid with interest. It is
            very similar to traditional borrowing from a bank, except that you
            borrow from lots of investors. Equity crowdfunding Sale of a stake
            in a business to a number of investors in return for investment. The
            idea is similar to how common stock is bought or sold on a stock
            exchange, or to a venture capital. Rewards-based crowdfunding
            Individuals donate to a project or business with expectations of
            receiving in return a non-financial reward, such as goods or
            services, at a later stage in exchange of their contribution.
            Donation-based crowdfunding Individuals donate small amounts to meet
            the larger funding aim of a specific charitable project while
            receiving no financial or material return. Profit-sharing /
            revenue-sharing Businesses can share future profits or revenues with
            the crowd in return for funding now. Debt-securities crowdfunding
            Individuals invest in a debt security issued by the company, such as
            a bond. Hybrid models Offer businesses the opportunity to combine
            elements of more than one crowdfunding type.
